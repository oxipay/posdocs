<strong>API reference: <a href="/resources/api_reference/#send-receipt">Receipt</a></strong>

It is highly recommended that upon successful transaction, POS sends a receipt number (unique to the transaction) back to Oxipay. Oxipay will store this internally and will use it for reconciling transactions. It will also be used for processing adjustments on transactions.
