This flow is a two step process. It applies where the pre-approval code is not available with the customer. POS can then facilitate the process by sending an invite (for the customer)to Oxipay. Oxipay will send a registration/login link to customer for them to obtain a pre-approval code. From this point onwards, the rest of the process is same as customer-initiated flow.
